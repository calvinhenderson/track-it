# TrackIt [![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/calvinhenderson/track-it/ci.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/calvinhenderson/track-it/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

An app that takes the mess out of tracking your assets. Forget logging equipment
in convoluted spreadsheets or in a messy notebook. Save yourself the hassle and
_Track-It!_

> :warning: This app is still considered highly experimental. Use at your own
risk.
